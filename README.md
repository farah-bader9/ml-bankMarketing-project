This project applies various machine learning models on the Bank Marketing dataset, including:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Linear Regression (converted to classification)

The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, and results were saved for each model.
